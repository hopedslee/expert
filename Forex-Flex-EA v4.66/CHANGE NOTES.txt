- Added FullBasketEquityTrail, when turned on it will allow Flex to start an EquityTrail at a defined loss pct (WhenToStart_FBET) for a full basket (reached max trades). This can be   useful if you want to try to get out of a full basket as quickly as possible even if it means at a loss. It will only kick in if you have a max trade basket, and it's DD comes      back above the (WhenToStart_FBET) value.

<<------------------INDICATORS---------------------->>

Added Indicators which can be used to either filter out new baskets from starting, or to trigger new baskets. If you want these indicators to just filter out trades, no special changes are required. If you want these indicators to trigger trades, turn on the ones you want, and set VirtualTrades to 1 and VirtualPipStep to 1.

-UseSR... This is a Support/Resistance filter which will prevent new baskets from starting near these levels
 NumOfBars... This is the number of bars on the current timeframe that are looked at to determine the               support and resistance levels.

-UseEMA... This is your standard Exponential Moving Average of the current time frame using the two EMA values you enter below

-UseStochastic... This is your standard Stochastic of the current time frame which will filter trades based on the 4 stoch settings below. If you don't want to use the first two, then set them to 0 and give the bottom two a value.
 BuyAboveStoch... A starting buy will only open if Stoch is above 50
 SellBelowStoch...A starting sell will only open if stoch is below 50
 BuyBelowStoch... A starting buy will only open if Stoch is below 50
 SellAboveStoch...A starting sell will only open if stoch is above 50

-UseTDI... This is an indicator similar to Traders Dynamic Index using 3 Moving Averages (2, 7, 25) where they must align properly to allow trades to open.

-UseTDICross... This will trigger a starting basket when the 3 MA's cross up or down (buy or sell).

-CheckTDiSlope... This will only open a buy if the trend is moving up and open a sell if the trend is moving down.



<<------------------ADDED FEATURES---------------------->>

Added VirtualPipStep so you can now use a different PipStep (for real orders) and one for virtual trades.

Added PauseBasketsAtDD which will prevent additional trades of a basket from opening until DD is back under the DD_Pause value

Adjusted start day to Monday and ending day to Thursday so new baskets will no longer be started on Sundays or Fridays.

Lowered ADR to 150 for all strategies

Added CloseTradesAtADR which will close that charts trades if ADR goes over MaxADR. This will almost always result in a loss, just so you know.

Added PauseBasketsAtADR which will not allow additional trades in a basket to open if ADR goes over MaxADR. The trade will be opened if ADR returns to normal.

EquityTrailSL now uses EquityTrailSL=EquityTrailTP-(EquityTrailStep*5) instead of *2

EquityTrail is now displayed on chart so you know when it is triggered and how much



<<------------------BUG FIXES---------------------->>

Fixed virtual data not saving or loading properly

Fixed bug with ADR displaying incorrectly on chart

Improved the MaxCharts function so it will be far less likely if two charts trigger trades at the exact same time, it can bypass the MaxCharts.

SuperPrecise, FlexHybrid, ADRDynamic and x3Retrace have all been slightly optimized for current market conditions

TrendSurfer has some minor adjustments to it's entry rules
